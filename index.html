      <h2>How Databases Write Data To Disk</h2>
      <p>If you are writing a computer program, and want to save some important data, how would you do it?  The simplest way would be just to write that data directly to your hard drive.  This is what a lot of programs do, and sometimes makes a lot of sense, but there are some issues with this approach.</p>

    <div class="section" id="different_types_of_databases">
      <h2>Different Types of Databases</h2>
      <p>Databases are divided into two types, Relational, and Non Relational.  Relational databases are the most common databases, but more recently non relational databases have become popular with large web companies like google and facebook because of their ability to handle huge amounts of data spread across hundreds or thousands of different computers.  In exchange for extreme flexibility and scalability, non relational databases give up the ability to easily index data.</p>
